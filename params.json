{"name":"Grafiti","tagline":"A general purpose infrastructure for multitouch gesture recognition management.","body":"Grafiti is a C# framework built on top of the [TUIO client](http://reactable.iua.upf.edu/?software) that manages multi-touch interactions in table-top interfaces. The possible use of tangible objects is particularly contemplated. It is designed to support the use of third party modules for (specialized) gesture recognition algorithms. However a set of modules for the recognition of some basic gestures is included in this project.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe development can be considered to be almost in the beta state.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe goals I've been aiming at are: generality, versatility, speed of execution, extensibility, ease of programming (integration) of external modules (simple APIs and protocols) and effective interface design with regards to HCI aspects.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nMore informations on the [blog](http://grafitiproject.wordpress.com/).\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nOriginally hosted [here](https://code.google.com/p/grafiti/)\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n***\r\nGSoC 2008 project\r\n<br/>\r\n![GSoC 2008](http://db.tt/7q0G6unN)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Alessandro De Nardi\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Mikael Bauer","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
