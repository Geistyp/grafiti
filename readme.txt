Grafiti is released under GPL v3 or later. For more information see license.txt.

GRAFITI IS CURRENTLY UNDER ITS EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S IN THE PRE-ALPHA STATE. SOME FUNCTIONALITIES ARE MISSING AND IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED PROPERLY. I UPLOAD THE CODE FOR SOME REASONS BUT I DON'T SUGGEST YOU TO USE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON.
