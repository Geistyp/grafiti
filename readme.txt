Gesture Recognition mAnagement Framework for Interactive Tabletop Interfaces.

Grafiti is released under GPL v3 or later. For more information see license.txt.

GRAFITI IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S STILL AN ALPHA VERSION. MANY FUNCTIONALITIES ARE MISSING AND IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED PROPERLY. I UPLOAD THE CODE FOR SOME REASONS BUT I DON'T SUGGEST YOU TO USE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON.
