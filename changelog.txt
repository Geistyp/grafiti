History of major changes and notes
----------------------------------

08-09-18(2)
- In Grafiti changed some variable names.
- In demo app fixed bug that sometimes caused crashings.
- Changes in keyboard input interface.

08-09-18
In Grafiti:
- New flag (xml configurable) to select automatic offset for Tuio's 
x coordinates.
In the demo:
- Added runtime-configurable perspective corrector.
- Added runtime control of the refresh rate.
- Cleaned main class.

08-09-17
- Removed C++ demo, added C# demo using Tao framework (OpenGL + 
FreeGlut). Now the only working demo is called "Grafiti Demo".
- Fixed bugs

08-09-07
- Introduced basic C++ demo project (with wrapper in C++/CLI)
- Modified some signatures of the exposed functions

08-08-12
- Improved control of GRs.
- Improved grouping.
- Fixed/handled bugs in the demo app, but some still exist using Mono.
- Put some helping comments.
- ...

08-08-11
Added touch support for GUI controls. Added some GRs. Various
improvements in the demo app. Many other changes.

08-08-05(2)
- simplified and improved method of declaration and retrieval of the state
of a processing GR.
- added auxiliar function to ovverride for client's handling of removal
target for LGR
- in GroupGRManager fixed bugs and tidy things up in Process()

08-08-05
- in groupGRManager.cs GRs coordination largely rewritten. Now all
available GRs will start processing, despite their priority number.
Now the first successful LGR will exclude other LGRs with different
targets, so that the local target can be only one.
- in Group.cs and GlobalGestureRecognizer.cs added new 
1-element-target-lists: closest initial target, closest new initial
target and closest final target
- in the demo project now it's possible to add and remove links 
between two tuio objects (for the removal it has been created a 
GGR that can use a client object as a resource)
- fixed some points in the demo project that would slow down the app
- fixed things that made the demo app to crash in mono 
- in Group.cs fixed a bug in calculating the centroid of recently
dead traces
- in many modules changed the name configuration in configurator,
that gives more the idea of an object
- in all GR classes fixed default configurator
- in various classes removed many 'new's called inside Tuio's 
refresh() method
- in Settings.cs better handling of errors in retrieving data from
setings.xml

08-07-31
- Lots of changes and bug fixes
- Added new demo app, showing framework features
- Removed first demo application

08-07-11
- Added 2 multitouch GRs:
  BasicMultiFingerGR.cs for basic tasks and
  PinchingGR.cs for classic image gestures
- In Group.cs, fixed some bugs in targeting algorithm;
- Fixed some bugs here and there
- In GestureEventArgs class, added group id field
- In Trace.cs, added trace id

08-07-05
- Fixed bug of tuio client regarding removed cursors

r9,r10,r11 08-06-27
Due to the large amount of changes the files have been reuploaded and 
not only updated.
- changed tuio client version, now it's 1.5 prerelease, modified. It's
still missing but I'll upload it soon
- improved group's targeting algorithm. Now tuio messages are processed
in "parallel" after each refresh()
- reorganized classes and solution's structure 

r8 08-06-14
- added LGR's constructor parameter 
- in Group.cs fixed bug in group's targeting algorithm
- in Group.cs added ProcessTerminated property
- split GestureRecognizer.cs in three files (GR + auxiliar classes, LGR
and GGR)
Tuio client missing.

r7 08-06-12
- added GestureEventmanager.cs (forgot in last revision)

r6 08-06-12
- In GroupGRManager.cs, refined coordination among GRs: now LGRs, on 
success, will prevent other LGRs of the same type from succeding.
- added closestTarget (entering/current/leaving) to GGRs
- added GGR for recognizing basic single-finger gestures: down, up, tap,
double tap, triple tap, hover, entering, move, leaving. It uses 
closestTarget.
- split Surface into two logical modules: Surface and
GestureEventManager.
Tuio client missing.

r5 08-06-07
In GroupGRManager.cs
- refined coordination among GRs (but still work in progress). quite tested.
In Group.cs
- added starting sequence of traces
Tuio client missing.

r4 08-06-05
Reorganized LGR and GGR managment (tidier classes, instanciation, priority),
but topic still in development. Tuio client missing. 

r3 08-05-25
First version. Tuio client missing.
